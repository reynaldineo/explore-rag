Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that combines the strengths of retrieval-based and generation-based models to improve the accuracy and relevance of generated text.

Key Components of RAG:
- Retriever: Searches a knowledge base for relevant documents or passages.
- Generator: Uses the retrieved information to produce coherent responses.
- Knowledge Base: A large collection of documents, often vectorized for efficient search.

Benefits:
- Reduces hallucinations in language models.
- Provides up-to-date information from external sources.
- Enhances factual accuracy in responses.

How RAG Works:
1. User query is encoded into a vector.
2. Vector search retrieves top-k relevant chunks.
3. Retrieved chunks are fed into the generator as context.
4. Generator produces the final answer based on the query and context.

Common Use Cases:
- Question-answering systems.
- Chatbots with domain-specific knowledge.
- Summarization of large documents.

Challenges:
- Quality of the knowledge base affects performance.
- Computational cost of embedding large datasets.
- Handling noisy or irrelevant retrieved information.
