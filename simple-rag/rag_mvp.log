  "answer": "I don't know, and here's why. The context doesn't provide any information about how to use RAG or Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for searching entities like Justin Bieber. The sources seem to be related to models, embeddings, generators, and indexing, but not specifically to entity search or retrieval.\n\nHowever, based on the context of the \"Applications\" section in sample.html, it seems that RAG can be used for customer support chatbots that pull from knowledge bases for accurate replies. But without more specific information about how to use RAG for this purpose, I couldn't provide a direct answer.\n\nIf you have any more information or clarification on how to use RAG for entity search, I'd be happy to try again!",
