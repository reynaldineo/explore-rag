ABSTRACT
Accurate document layout analysis is a key requirement for high-
quality PDF document conversion. With the recent availability of
public, large ground-truth datasets such as PubLayNet and DocBank,
deep-learning models have proven to be very effective at layout
detection and segmentation. While these datasets are of adequate
size to train such models, they severely lack in layout variability
since they are sourced from scientific article repositories such as
PubMed and arXiv only. Consequently, the accuracy of the layout
segmentation drops significantly when these models are applied
on more challenging and diverse layouts. In this paper, we present
DocLayNet, a new, publicly available, document-layout annotation
dataset in COCO format. It contains 80863 manually annotated
pages from diverse data sources to represent a wide variability in
layouts. For each PDF page, the layout annotations provide labelled
bounding-boxes with a choice of 11 distinct classes. DocLayNet
also provides a subset of double- and triple-annotated pages to
determine the inter-annotator agreement. In multiple experiments,
we provide baseline accuracy scores (in mAP) for a set of popular
object detection models. We also demonstrate that these models
fall approximately 10% behind the inter-annotator agreement. Fur-
thermore, we provide evidence that DocLayNet is of sufficient size.
Lastly, we compare models trained on PubLayNet, DocBank and
DocLayNet, showing that layout predictions of the DocLayNet-
trained models are more robust and thus the preferred choice for
general-purpose document-layout analysis.

USING THE VERTICAL TUBE -MODELS AY11230/112341. The vertical tube can be used for       instructional viewing or to photograph     the image with a digital camera or a     micro TV unit 2. Loosen the retention screw, then rotate      the adjustment ring to change the       length of the vertical tube.3. Make sure that both the images in 
OPERATION (cont.)SELECTING OBJECTIVE MAGNIFICATION  1. There are two objectives. The lower      magnification objective has a greater      depth of field and view.2. In order to observe the specimen      easily use the lower magnification      objective first. Then, by rotating the      case, the magnification can be       changed.CHANGING THE INTERPUPILLARY DISTANCE1. The distance between the observer's      pupils is the interpupillary distance.   2. To adjust the interpupillary distance      rotate the prism caps until both eyes      coincide with the image in the       eyepiece.  FOCUSING1. Remove the lens protective cover.2. Place the specimen on the working      stage.3. Focus the specimen with the left eye      first while turning the focus knob until      the image appears clear and sharp.4. Rotate the right eyepiece ring until the      images in each eyepiece coincide and      are sharp and clear.CHANGING THE BULB1. Disconnect the power cord.2. When the bulb is cool, remove the      oblique illuminator cap and remove      the halogen bulb with cap.3. Replace with a new halogen bulb.4. Open the window in the base plate and      replace the halogen lamp or       fluorescent lamp of transmitted       illuminator.
FOCUSING1. Turn the focusing knob away or toward      you until a clear image is viewed.2. If the image is unclear, adjust the      height of the elevator up or down,      then turn the focusing knob again.ZOOM MAGNIFICATION1. Turn the zoom magnification knob to      the desired magnification and field of      view.2. In most situations, it is recommended      that you focus at the lowest       magnification, then move to a higher      magnification and re-focus as       necessary.3. If the image is not clear to both eyes      at the same time, the diopter ring may      need adjustment.DIOPTER RING ADJUSTMENT1. To adjust the eyepiece for viewing with      or without eyeglasses and for       differences in acuity between the right      and left eyes, follow the following      steps:    a. Observe an image through the left          eyepiece and bring a specific point          into focus using the focus knob.    b. By turning the diopter ring           adjustment for the left eyepiece,          bring the same point into sharp          focus.     c.Then bring the same point into          focus through the right eyepiece           by turning the right diopter ring.     d.With more than one viewer, each          viewer should note their own           diopter ring position for the left           and right eyepieces, then before          viewing set the diopter ring           adjustments to that setting.CHANGING THE BULB1. Disconnect the power cord from the      electrical outlet.2. When the bulb is cool, remove the      oblique illuminator cap and remove      the halogen bulb with cap.3. Replace with a new halogen bulb.4. Open the window in the base plate       and replace the halogen lamp or      fluorescent lamp of transmitted       illuminator.

1 INTRODUCTION
Despite the substantial improvements achieved with machine-learning
(ML) approaches and deep neural networks in recent years, docu-
ment conversion remains a challenging problem, as demonstrated
by the numerous public competitions held on this topic [1–4]. The
challenge originates from the huge variability in PDF documents
regarding layout, language and formats (scanned, programmatic
or a combination of both). Engineering a single ML model that can
be applied on all types of documents and provides high-quality
layout segmentation remains to this day extremely challenging [5].
To highlight the variability in document layouts, we show a few
example documents from the DocLayNet dataset in Figure 1.
A key problem in the process of document conversion is to under-
stand the structure of a single document page, i.e. which segments
of text should be grouped together in a unit. To train models for this
task, there are currently two large datasets available to the com-
munity, PubLayNet [6] and DocBank [7]. They were introduced
in 2019 and 2020 respectively and significantly accelerated the im-
plementation of layout detection and segmentation models due to
their sizes of 300K and 500K ground-truth pages. These sizes were
achieved by leveraging an automation approach. The benefit of au-
tomated ground-truth generation is obvious: one can generate large
ground-truth datasets at virtually no cost. However, the automation
introduces a constraint on the variability in the dataset, because
corresponding structured source data must be available. PubLayNet
and DocBank were both generated from scientific document repos-
itories (PubMed and arXiv), which provide XML or LATEX sources.
Those scientific documents present a limited variability in their
layouts, because they are typeset in uniform templates provided by
the publishers. Obviously, documents such as technical manuals,
annual company reports, legal text, government tenders, etc. have
very different and partially unique layouts. As a consequence, the
layout predictions obtained from models trained on PubLayNet or
DocBank is very reasonable when applied on scientific documents.
However, for more artistic or free-style layouts, we see sub-par
prediction quality from these models, which we demonstrate in
Section 5.
In this paper, we present the DocLayNet dataset. It provides page-
by-page layout annotation ground-truth using bounding-boxes for
11 distinct class labels on 80863 unique document pages, of which
a fraction carry double- or triple-annotations. DocLayNet is similar
in spirit to PubLayNet and DocBank and will likewise be made
available to the public1 in order to stimulate the document-layout
analysis community. It distinguishes itself in the following aspects:
(1) Human Annotation: In contrast to PubLayNet and DocBank,
we relied on human annotation instead of automation ap-
proaches to generate the data set.
(2) Large Layout Variability: We include diverse and complex
layouts from a large variety of public sources.
(3) Detailed Label Set : We define 11 class labels to distinguish
layout features in high detail. PubLayNet provides 5 labels;
DocBank provides 13, although not a superset of ours.
(4) Redundant Annotations: A fraction of the pages in the Do-
cLayNet data set carry more than one human annotation.
1https://developer.ibm.com/exchanges/data/all/doclaynet
This enables experimentation with annotation uncertainty
and quality control analysis.
(5) Pre-defined Train-, Test- & Validation-set: Like DocBank, we
provide fixed train-, test- & validation-sets to ensure propor-
tional representation of the class-labels. Further, we prevent
leakage of unique layouts across sets, which has a large effect
on model accuracy scores.
All aspects outlined above are detailed in Section 3. In Section 4,
we will elaborate on how we designed and executed this large-scale
human annotation campaign. We will also share key insights and
lessons learned that might prove helpful for other parties planning
to set up annotation campaigns.
In Section 5, we will present baseline accuracy numbers for a
variety of object detection methods (Faster R-CNN, Mask R-CNN
and YOLOv5) trained on DocLayNet. We further show how the
model performance is impacted by varying the DocLayNet dataset
size, reducing the label set and modifying the train/test-split. Last
but not least, we compare the performance of models trained on
PubLayNet, DocBank and DocLayNet and demonstrate that a model
trained on DocLayNet provides overall more robust layout recovery.
2 RELATED WORK
While early approaches in document-layout analysis used rule-
based algorithms and heuristics [8], the problem is lately addressed
with deep learning methods. The most common approach is to lever-
age object detection models [9–15]. In the last decade, the accuracy
and speed of these models has increased dramatically. Furthermore,
most state-of-the-art object detection methods can be trained and
applied with very little work, thanks to a standardisation effort
of the ground-truth data format [16] and common deep-learning
frameworks [17]. Reference data sets such as PubLayNet [6] and
DocBank provide their data in the commonly accepted COCO for-
mat [16].
Lately, new types of ML models for document-layout analysis
have emerged in the community [ 18–21]. These models do not
approach the problem of layout analysis purely based on an image
representation of the page, as computer vision methods do. Instead,
they combine the text tokens and image representation of a page
in order to obtain a segmentation. While the reported accuracies
appear to be promising, a broadly accepted data format which links
geometric and textual features has yet to establish.
3 THE DOCLAYNET DATASET
DocLayNet contains 80863 PDF pages. Among these, 7059 carry two
instances of human annotations, and 1591 carry three. This amounts
to 91104 total annotation instances. The annotations provide lay-
out information in the shape of labeled, rectangular bounding-
boxes. We define 11 distinct labels for layout features, namely Cap-
tion, Footnote, Formula, List-item, Page-footer, Page-header, Picture,
Section-header, Table, Text, and Title. Our reasoning for picking this
particular label set is detailed in Section 4.
In addition to open intellectual property constraints for the
source documents, we required that the documents in DocLayNet
adhere to a few conditions. Firstly, we kept scanned documents

to a minimum, since they introduce difficulties in annotation (see
Section 4). As a second condition, we focussed on medium to large
documents (> 10 pages) with technical content, dense in complex
tables, figures, plots and captions. Such documents carry a lot of
information value, but are often hard to analyse with high accuracy
due to their challenging layouts. Counterexamples of documents
not included in the dataset are receipts, invoices, hand-written
documents or photographs showing “text in the wild".
The pages in DocLayNet can be grouped into six distinct cate-
gories, namely Financial Reports, Manuals, Scientific Articles, Laws &
Regulations, Patents and Government Tenders. Each document cate-
gory was sourced from various repositories. For example, Financial
Reports contain both free-style format annual reports2 which ex-
pose company-specific, artistic layouts as well as the more formal
SEC filings. The two largest categories (Financial Reports and Man-
uals) contain a large amount of free-style layouts in order to obtain
maximum variability. In the other four categories, we boosted the
variability by mixing documents from independent providers, such
as different government websites or publishers. In Figure 2, we
show the document categories contained in DocLayNet with their
respective sizes.
We did not control the document selection with regard to lan-
guage. The vast majority of documents contained in DocLayNet
(close to 95%) are published in English language. However, Do-
cLayNet also contains a number of documents in other languages
such as German (2.5%), French (1.0%) and Japanese (1.0%). While
the document language has negligible impact on the performance
of computer vision methods such as object detection and segmenta-
tion models, it might prove challenging for layout analysis methods
which exploit textual features.
To ensure that future benchmarks in the document-layout analy-
sis community can be easily compared, we have split up DocLayNet
into pre-defined train-, test- and validation-sets. In this way, we can
avoid spurious variations in the evaluation scores due to random
splitting in train-, test- and validation-sets. We also ensured that
less frequent labels are represented in train and test sets in equal
proportions.
2e.g. AAPL from https://www.annualreports.com/
Table 1 shows the overall frequency and distribution of the labels
among the different sets. Importantly, we ensure that subsets are
only split on full-document boundaries. This avoids that pages of
the same document are spread over train, test and validation set,
which can give an undesired evaluation advantage to models and
lead to overestimation of their prediction accuracy. We will show
the impact of this decision in Section 5.
In order to accommodate the different types of models currently
in use by the community, we provide DocLayNet in an augmented
COCO format [16]. This entails the standard COCO ground-truth
file (in JSON format) with the associated page images (in PNG
format, 1025×1025 pixels). Furthermore, custom fields have been
added to each COCO record to specify document category, original
document filename and page number. In addition, we also provide
the original PDF pages, as well as sidecar files containing parsed
PDF text and text-cell coordinates (in JSON). All additional files are
linked to the primary page images by their matching filenames.
Despite being cost-intense and far less scalable than automation,
human annotation has several benefits over automated ground-
truth generation. The first and most obvious reason to leverage
human annotations is the freedom to annotate any type of doc-
ument without requiring a programmatic source. For most PDF
documents, the original source document is not available. The lat-
ter is not a hard constraint with human annotation, but it is for
automated methods. A second reason to use human annotations is
that the latter usually provide a more natural interpretation of the
page layout. The human-interpreted layout can significantly devi-
ate from the programmatic layout used in typesetting. For example,
“invisible” tables might be used solely for aligning text paragraphs
on columns. Such typesetting tricks might be interpreted by au-
tomated methods incorrectly as an actual table, while the human
annotation will interpret it correctly as Text or other styles. The
same applies to multi-line text elements, when authors decided to
space them as “invisible” list elements without bullet symbols. A
third reason to gather ground-truth through human annotation is
to estimate a “natural” upper bound on the segmentation accuracy.
As we will show in Section 4, certain documents featuring complex
layouts can have different but equally acceptable layout interpre-
tations. This natural upper bound for segmentation accuracy can
be found by annotating the same pages multiple times by different
people and evaluating the inter-annotator agreement. Such a base-
line consistency evaluation is very useful to define expectations
for a good target accuracy in trained deep neural network models
and avoid overfitting (see Table 1). On the flip side, achieving high
annotation consistency proved to be a key challenge in human
annotation, as we outline in Section 4.
4 ANNOTATION CAMPAIGN
The annotation campaign was carried out in four phases. In phase
one, we identified and prepared the data sources for annotation.
In phase two, we determined the class labels and how annotations
should be done on the documents in order to obtain maximum con-
sistency. The latter was guided by a detailed requirement analysis
and exhaustive experiments. In phase three, we trained the annota-
tion staff and performed exams for quality assurance. In phase four,

we distributed the annotation workload and performed continuous
quality controls. Phase one and two required a small team of experts
only. For phases three and four, a group of 40 dedicated annotators
were assembled and supervised.
Phase 1: Data selection and preparation. Our inclusion cri-
teria for documents were described in Section 3. A large effort went
into ensuring that all documents are free to use. The data sources
include publication repositories such as arXiv3, government offices,
company websites as well as data directory services for financial
reports and patents. Scanned documents were excluded wherever
possible because they can be rotated or skewed. This would not
allow us to perform annotation with rectangular bounding-boxes
and therefore complicate the annotation process.
Preparation work included uploading and parsing the sourced
PDF documents in the Corpus Conversion Service (CCS) [ 22], a
cloud-native platform which provides a visual annotation interface
and allows for dataset inspection and analysis. The annotation in-
terface of CCS is shown in Figure 3. The desired balance of pages
between the different document categories was achieved by se-
lective subsampling of pages with certain desired properties. For
example, we made sure to include the title page of each document
and bias the remaining page selection to those with figures or
tables. The latter was achieved by leveraging pre-trained object
detection models from PubLayNet, which helped us estimate how
many figures and tables a given page contains.
Phase 2: Label selection and guideline. We reviewed the col-
lected documents and identified the most common structural fea-
tures they exhibit. This was achieved by identifying recurrent layout
elements and lead us to the definition of 11 distinct class labels.
These 11 class labels are Caption, Footnote, Formula, List-item, Page-
footer, Page-header, Picture, Section-header, Table, Text, and Title.
Critical factors that were considered for the choice of these class
labels were (1) the overall occurrence of the label, (2) the specificity
of the label, (3) recognisability on a single page (i.e. no need for
context from previous or next page) and (4) overall coverage of the
page. Specificity ensures that the choice of label is not ambiguous,
while coverage ensures that all meaningful items on a page can
be annotated. We refrained from class labels that are very specific
to a document category, such as Abstract in the Scientific Articles
category. We also avoided class labels that are tightly linked to the
semantics of the text. Labels such as Author and Affiliation, as seen
in DocBank, are often only distinguishable by discriminating on

the textual content of an element, which goes beyond visual layout
recognition, in particular outside the Scientific Articles category.
At first sight, the task of visual document-layout interpretation
appears intuitive enough to obtain plausible annotations in most
cases. However, during early trial-runs in the core team, we ob-
served many cases in which annotators use different annotation
styles, especially for documents with challenging layouts. For ex-
ample, if a figure is presented with subfigures, one annotator might
draw a single figure bounding-box, while another might annotate
each subfigure separately. The same applies for lists, where one
might annotate all list items in one block or each list item sep-
arately. In essence, we observed that challenging layouts would
be annotated in different but plausible ways. To illustrate this, we
show in Figure 4 multiple examples of plausible but inconsistent
annotations on the same pages.
Obviously, this inconsistency in annotations is not desirable for
datasets which are intended to be used for model training. To min-
imise these inconsistencies, we created a detailed annotation guide-
line. While perfect consistency across 40 annotation staff members
is clearly not possible to achieve, we saw a huge improvement in
annotation consistency after the introduction of our annotation
guideline. A few selected, non-trivial highlights of the guideline
are:
(1) Every list-item is an individual object instance with class
label List-item. This definition is different from PubLayNet
and DocBank, where all list-items are grouped together into
one List object.
(2) A List-item is a paragraph with hanging indentation. Single-
line elements can qualify as List-item if the neighbour ele-
ments expose hanging indentation. Bullet or enumeration
symbols are not a requirement.
(3) For every Caption, there must be exactly one corresponding
Picture or Table.
(4) Connected sub-pictures are grouped together in one Picture
object.
(5) Formula numbers are included in a Formula object.
(6) Emphasised text (e.g. in italic or bold) at the beginning of
a paragraph is not considered a Section-header, unless it
appears exclusively on its own line.
The complete annotation guideline is over 100 pages long and a
detailed description is obviously out of scope for this paper. Never-
theless, it will be made publicly available alongside with DocLayNet
for future reference.
Phase 3: Training. After a first trial with a small group of peo-
ple, we realised that providing the annotation guideline and a set of
random practice pages did not yield the desired quality level for lay-
out annotation. Therefore we prepared a subset of pages with two
different complexity levels, each with a practice and an exam part.
974 pages were reference-annotated by one proficient core team
member. Annotation staff were then given the task to annotate the
same subsets (blinded from the reference). By comparing the an-
notations of each staff member with the reference annotations, we
could quantify how closely their annotations matched the reference.
Only after passing two exam levels with high annotation quality,
staff were admitted into the production phase. Practice iterations

were carried out over a timeframe of 12 weeks, after which 8 of the
40 initially allocated annotators did not pass the bar.
Phase 4: Production annotation. The previously selected 80K
pages were annotated with the defined 11 class labels by 32 annota-
tors. This production phase took around three months to complete.
All annotations were created online through CCS, which visualises
the programmatic PDF text-cells as an overlay on the page. The page
annotation are obtained by drawing rectangular bounding-boxes,
as shown in Figure 3. With regard to the annotation practices, we
implemented a few constraints and capabilities on the tooling level.
First, we only allow non-overlapping, vertically oriented, rectangu-
lar boxes. For the large majority of documents, this constraint was
sufficient and it speeds up the annotation considerably in compar-
ison with arbitrary segmentation shapes. Second, annotator staff
were not able to see each other’s annotations. This was enforced by
design to avoid any bias in the annotation, which could skew the
numbers of the inter-annotator agreement (see Table 1). We wanted

to avoid this at any cost in order to have clear, unbiased baseline
numbers for human document-layout annotation. Third, we in-
troduced the feature of snapping boxes around text segments to
obtain a pixel-accurate annotation and again reduce time and effort.
The CCS annotation tool automatically shrinks every user-drawn
box to the minimum bounding-box around the enclosed text-cells
for all purely text-based segments, which excludes only Table and
Picture. For the latter, we instructed annotation staff to minimise
inclusion of surrounding whitespace while including all graphical
lines. A downside of snapping boxes to enclosed text cells is that
some wrongly parsed PDF pages cannot be annotated correctly and
need to be skipped. Fourth, we established a way to flag pages as
rejected for cases where no valid annotation according to the label
guidelines could be achieved. Example cases for this would be PDF
pages that render incorrectly or contain layouts that are impossible
to capture with non-overlapping rectangles. Such rejected pages are
not contained in the final dataset. With all these measures in place,
experienced annotation staff managed to annotate a single page in
a typical timeframe of 20s to 60s, depending on its complexity.
5 EXPERIMENTS
The primary goal of DocLayNet is to obtain high-quality ML models
capable of accurate document-layout analysis on a wide variety
of challenging layouts. As discussed in Section 2, object detection
models are currently the easiest to use, due to the standardisation
of ground-truth data in COCO format [16] and the availability of
general frameworks such as detectron2 [17]. Furthermore, baseline
numbers in PubLayNet and DocBank were obtained using standard
object detection models such as Mask R-CNN and Faster R-CNN.
As such, we will relate to these object detection methods in this

significantly better predictions.
paper and leave the detailed evaluation of more recent methods
mentioned in Section 2 for future work.
In this section, we will present several aspects related to the
performance of object detection models on DocLayNet. Similarly
as in PubLayNet, we will evaluate the quality of their predictions
using mean average precision (mAP) with 10 overlaps that range
from 0.5 to 0.95 in steps of 0.05 (mAP@0.5-0.95). These scores are
computed by leveraging the evaluation code provided by the COCO
API [16].
Baselines for Object Detection
In Table 2, we present baseline experiments (given in mAP) on Mask
R-CNN [12], Faster R-CNN [11], and YOLOv5 [13]. Both training
and evaluation were performed on RGB images with dimensions of
1025×1025 pixels. For training, we only used one annotation in case
of redundantly annotated pages. As one can observe, the variation
in mAP between the models is rather low, but overall between 6
and 10% lower than the mAP computed from the pairwise human
annotations on triple-annotated pages. This gives a good indication
that the DocLayNet dataset poses a worthwhile challenge for the
research community to close the gap between human recognition
and ML approaches. It is interesting to see that Mask R-CNN and
Faster R-CNN produce very comparable mAP scores, indicating
that pixel-based image segmentation derived from bounding-boxes
does not help to obtain better predictions. On the other hand, the
more recent Yolov5x model does very well and even out-performs
humans on selected labels such as Text, Table and Picture. This is
not entirely surprising, as Text, Table and Picture are abundant and
the most visually distinctive in a document.

Learning Curve
One of the fundamental questions related to any dataset is if it is
“large enough”. To answer this question for DocLayNet, we per-
formed a data ablation study in which we evaluated a Mask R-CNN
model trained on increasing fractions of the DocLayNet dataset.
As can be seen in Figure 5, the mAP score rises sharply in the be-
ginning and eventually levels out. To estimate the error-bar on the
metrics, we ran the training five times on the entire data-set. This
resulted in a 1% error-bar, depicted by the shaded area in Figure 5.
In the inset of Figure 5, we show the exact same data-points, but
with a logarithmic scale on the x-axis. As is expected, the mAP
score increases linearly as a function of the data-size in the inset.
The curve ultimately flattens out between the 80% and 100% mark,
with the 80% mark falling within the error-bars of the 100% mark.
This provides a good indication that the model would not improve
significantly by yet increasing the data size. Rather, it would prob-
ably benefit more from improved data consistency (as discussed
in Section 3), data augmentation methods [23], or the addition of
more document categories and styles.
Impact of Class Labels
The choice and number of labels can have a significant effect on
the overall model performance. Since PubLayNet, DocBank and
DocLayNet all have different label sets, it is of particular interest to
understand and quantify this influence of the label set on the model
performance. We investigate this by either down-mapping labels
into more common ones (e.g. Caption→Text) or excluding them
from the annotations entirely. Furthermore, it must be stressed
that all mappings and exclusions were performed on the data be-
fore model training. In Table 3, we present the mAP scores for a
Mask R-CNN R50 network on different label sets. Where a label
is down-mapped, we show its corresponding label, otherwise it
was excluded. We present three different label sets, with 6, 5 and 4
different labels respectively. The set of 5 labels contains the same
labels as PubLayNet. However, due to the different definition of

lists in PubLayNet (grouped list-items) versus DocLayNet (separate
list-items), the label set of size 4 is the closest to PubLayNet, in the
assumption that the List is down-mapped to Text in PubLayNet.
The results in Table 3 show that the prediction accuracy on the
remaining class labels does not change significantly when other
classes are merged into them. The overall macro-average improves
by around 5%, in particular when Page-footer and Page-header are
excluded.
Impact of Document Split in Train and Test Set
Many documents in DocLayNet have a unique styling. In order
to avoid overfitting on a particular style, we have split the train-,
test- and validation-sets of DocLayNet on document boundaries, i.e.
every document contributes pages to only one set. To the best of
our knowledge, this was not considered in PubLayNet or DocBank.
To quantify how this affects model performance, we trained and
evaluated a Mask R-CNN R50 model on a modified dataset version.
Here, the train-, test- and validation-sets were obtained by a ran-
domised draw over the individual pages. As can be seen in Table 4,
the difference in model performance is surprisingly large: page-
wise splitting gains ˜10% in mAP over the document-wise splitting.
Thus, random page-wise splitting of DocLayNet can easily lead
to accidental overestimation of model performance and should be
avoided.
Dataset Comparison
Throughout this paper, we claim that DocLayNet’s wider variety of
document layouts leads to more robust layout detection models. In
Table 5, we provide evidence for that. We trained models on each
of the available datasets (PubLayNet, DocBank and DocLayNet)
and evaluated them on the test sets of the other datasets. Due to
the different label sets and annotation styles, a direct comparison
is not possible. Hence, we focussed on the common labels among
the datasets. Between PubLayNet and DocLayNet, these are Picture,

has much less pronounced variations in performance across
all datasets.

Section-header, Table and Text. Before training, we either mapped
or excluded DocLayNet’s other labels as specified in table 3, and
also PubLayNet’sList to Text. Note that the different clustering of
lists (by list-element vs. whole list objects) naturally decreases the
mAP score for Text.
For comparison of DocBank with DocLayNet, we trained only
on Picture and Table clusters of each dataset. We had to excludeText
because successive paragraphs are often grouped together into a
single object in DocBank. This paragraph grouping is incompatible
with the individual paragraphs of DocLayNet. As can be seen in
Table 5, DocLayNet trained models yield better performance com-
pared to the previous datasets. It is noteworthy that the models
trained on PubLayNet and DocBank perform very well on their
own test set, but have a much lower performance on the foreign
datasets. While this also applies to DocLayNet, the difference is
far less pronounced. Thus we conclude that DocLayNet trained
models are overall more robust and will produce better results for
challenging, unseen layouts.
Example Predictions
To conclude this section, we illustrate the quality of layout predic-
tions one can expect from DocLayNet-trained models by providing
a selection of examples without any further post-processing ap-
plied. Figure 6 shows selected layout predictions on pages from the
test-set of DocLayNet. Results look decent in general across docu-
ment categories, however one can also observe mistakes such as
overlapping clusters of different classes, or entirely missing boxes
due to low confidence.
6 CONCLUSION
In this paper, we presented the DocLayNet dataset. It provides the
document conversion and layout analysis research community a
new and challenging dataset to improve and fine-tune novel ML
methods on. In contrast to many other datasets, DocLayNet was
created by human annotation in order to obtain reliable layout
ground-truth on a wide variety of publication- and typesetting-
styles. Including a large proportion of documents outside the scien-
tific publishing domain adds significant value in this respect.
From the dataset, we have derived on the one hand reference
metrics for human performance on document-layout annotation
(through double and triple annotations) and on the other hand eval-
uated the baseline performance of commonly used object detection
methods. We also illustrated the impact of various dataset-related
aspects on model performance through data-ablation experiments,
both from a size and class-label perspective. Last but not least, we
compared the accuracy of models trained on other public datasets
and showed that DocLayNet trained models are more robust.
To date, there is still a significant gap between human and ML
accuracy on the layout interpretation task, and we hope that this
work will inspire the research community to close that gap.
